In order to run the program, please do the following things:

	If you are using a mac: 
		1) Open your terminal
		2) 
	           a) Type "./executer.sh" for actual model.
		   b) Type "./extended-executer.sh" for extended model.
	
		3) Press enter

	If you are using a windows machine:
		a) Run executer.bat for actual model
		b) Run extended-executer.bat for extended model.

You will see a GUI now. By using it, you can arrange your values and click on 
"Set and Run". Since the GUI is an additional material to make the model 
easier to use, we have not put effort on input controls like -->  Cop Density + 
Citizen Density < 100. 
	
Since the program will run indefinetly, please stop it at some point by
clicking on "Terminate" button.

Now, please navigate to: Rebellion/src

Open up numeric_output.csv to check the results for each tick.



The source code can be found under Rebellion/src.
